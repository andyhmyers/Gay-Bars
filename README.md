## Bars in Gay Friendly Cities

by Andy Myers

This dataset, from [data.world](https://data.world/the-pudding/gayborhoods) includes information concerning the demographics of cities containing a concentration of LGBTQ+ identifying folks, specifically showing patterns in martital status, bars and taxes.

TO DO; visuals

The above visualization contains the number of understood LGBTQ+ bars per zipcode, specifically showing the top 15 zipcodes in the United States with the most amount of gay bars. While the source of the data unfortunately does not include city names, the top 4 zipcodes translate to these cities in order: San Francisco (17 bars), West Hollywood (15 bars), Seattle (12 bars), and New York (10 bars). Locating places to drink may seem insignificant on the surface, but for the LGBTQ+ community, it often serves as important information. Many queer/trans folks seeking to move to a more LGBTQ+ friendly area frequently take into account the number of gay bars, as those serve as central safe spaces to find others in the community.
